Euclidean algorithms (Basic and Extended)
Basic Euclidean Algorithm for GCD
If we subtract smaller number from larger (we reduce larger number), GCD doesnâ€™t change. So if we keep subtracting repeatedly the larger of two,
we end up with GCD. Now instead of subtraction, if we divide smaller number, the algorithm stops when we find remainder 0.
Time Complexity: O(Log min(a, b))

Extended Euclidean Algorithm:
Extended Euclidean algorithm also finds integer coefficients x and y such that:  ax + by = gcd(a, b) 

// Recursive function to return gcd of a and b-Basic Euclidean Algorithm 
int gcd(int a, int b) 
{ 
    if (b == 0) 
        return a; 
    return gcd(b, a % b);  
      
}
